# Reddit Browser

A terminal-based TUI for browsing Reddit built with Textual. This was entirely vibe coded to scratch an itch - no support, no maintenance, just vibes.

## Usage

```bash
python run.py [subreddit]
```

Defaults to r/LocalLlama if no subreddit specified.

## Vibe Dependencies

- textual
- httpx

Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Controls

- `j`/`k`: Navigate posts
- `r`: Refresh
- `q`: Quit
- `Enter`: Open post
- Numbers: Jump to specific post

## Notes

This was vibe coded to satisfy a specific need. I'm not going to support it in any way, it's provided here as is for other people's inspiration and I don't intend to improve or maintain it. Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like.
